- Works by associating rules w/ HTML elements 
- Rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed


p {
  font-family: Arial;
  }
  
  /* "p" is selector. */
  /* "{font-family: Arial;}" is declaration */
    /* "font-family" is property*/
    /* "Arial" is value*/
   
   
   Link HTHML and CSS
      - External CSS (inside head)
      <link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
      
      
   Specificity by degree (lowest to highest) (easiest to hardest to override)
      - tag p
      - classes="" .classes
      - id="" #id
      
    Chaining Selector
      - CSS selectors can be chained so that rule sets apply only to elements that match all criteria
      - h3.selection
